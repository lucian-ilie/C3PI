# Model Files Directory


This directory is intended to contain large model files necessary for running various parts of our application. Due to their substantial size, these files are not hosted directly within this GitHub repository.

## Accessing the Model Files

In order to facilitate easy access and maintain efficiency, we have hosted these large files on an external server. Please use the link below to download the model files you need:

üåê [CNN1D](http://c3pi.csd.uwo.ca/archive/CNN1D) _(File size ~ 800MB)_

üåê [CNN2D](http://c3pi.csd.uwo.ca/archive/CNN2D) _(File size ~ 1GB)_

## How to Use the Model Files

After downloading the model files from the above link, please follow the setup instructions provided in the main repository's `README.md` to properly integrate these files with the rest of the application.
